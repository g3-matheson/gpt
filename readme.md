# ChatGPT C\# Wrapper

I use this C\# CLI tool to communicate directly with OpenAI's GPT API so that I don't have to jump back and forth between my IDE and Browser when I have small questions.

Not super user-friendly at the moment (the release of Codex kind of killed my progress!), but usage can be inferred from *GPTArgumentParser.Flags* in *chatgpt-parser.csx*.
