* add function to file parser to get total tokens in the conversation

* change to dotnet build to speed up program, it's getting slower as more functionality is added
    - dotnet new console -n GPT
    - rename .csx to .cs
    - Program.cs should have static void Main(string[] args)
    - dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -o ./publish/linux
    - --self-contained false --> builds without .NET integrated inside
        - don't forget to make it executable! chmod +x

* add functionality to send files by name as input

* add default Filename generation from ChatGPT itself. ask it what a 3 word (w1,w2,w3) summary would be for the convo,
save the file as $"{date}-w1-w2-w3.json"
