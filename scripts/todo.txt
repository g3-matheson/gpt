**** in PRIO
* add function to file parser to get total tokens in the conversation

* change to dotnet build to speed up program, it's getting slower as more functionality is added
    * the "#load" are also getting confusing, as well as naming -- might need services or events etc.
    * this .exe is absolutely needed since a lot of work breaks gpt 
        and then i can't call it while working on it    
    * chatgpt instructions:
        - dotnet new console -n GPT
        - rename .csx to .cs
        - Program.cs should have static void Main(string[] args)
        - dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -o ./publish/linux
        - --self-contained false --> builds without .NET integrated inside
            - don't forget to make it executable

* add functionality to send files by name as input

* add Filename generation from ChatGPT itself. ask it what a 3 word summary would be for the convo,
save the file as $"{date}-w1-w2-w3.json"
