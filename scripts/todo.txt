TODO:
== short-term
    * parser: add 'read from this file" functionality
    * finish IArgumentParser so that it can use the implied inherited _flags    


== long-term
    * Rewrite .sh components to allow for any input, that is then parsed by chatgpt-parser.csx
    * chatgpt-session.csx: use prior messages as context for continued convo
        -- call when required as per parsing results
