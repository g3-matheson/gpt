    * chatgpt-parser.csx: parsing CLI arguments
        * --context ("messages" can have multiple inputs from different roles)
            roles:
                system: 
                    - set the behavior or context for the model
                    - guideline for how model should act / persona it should adopt
                user:
                    - end user message, prompt
                assistant(?)
                    - model's responses during the conversation
                    - outputs generatd by the model based on 'user' input guided by 'system' input
                    - warrants more reading...
        * --max-tokens
        * --tokens-left ?
